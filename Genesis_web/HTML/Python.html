                <h1>What is python?</h1>
                <p>Python is a general purpose programming language used for many purpose. It is the fastest growing programming language today.</p>
                <p>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.</p>
                <p>Python was originally conceptualized by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s as a member of the National Research Institute of Mathematics and Computer Science. Initially, it was designed as a response to the ABC programming language that was also foregrounded in the Netherlands.</p>
                <p> Of course, Python, like other languages, has gone through a number of versions. Python 0.9.0 was first released in 1991. In addition to exception handling, Python included classes, lists, and strings. More importantly, it included lambda, map, filter and reduce, which aligned it heavily in relation to functional programming.</p>
                <p>In 2000, Python 2.0 was released. This version of was more of an open-source project from members of the National Research Institute of Mathematics and Computer Science. This version of Python included list comprehensions, a full garbage collector, and it supported Unicode.</p>
                <p>Python 3.0 was the next version and was released in December of 2008 (the latest version of Python is 3.6.4). Although Python 2 and 3 are similar there are subtle differences. Perhaps most noticeably is the way the print statement works, as in Python 3.0 the print statement has been replaced with a print () function.</p>

                <h1>Why Programmers Should Learn Python in 2019?</h1>

                <p> If you are thinking to learn Python but not sure why you should do that then here are 10 reasons which highlight the benefits of learning Python in 2019. </p>
                 
                <p>Though, the questions depend upon who is asking that i.e. for a beginner, learning Python makes sense because its simple and main reason for learning Python is simplicity.
                </p>

                <p>Similarly, for an experienced programmer who is looking to go into Data Science and Machine learning, learning Python makes sense because it’s quickly becoming the most used programming language and there are powerful APIs and library available for AI, Data Science, and Machine learning.
                </p>

                <p>Anyway, without any further a do, <strong> here are the 4 reasons to learn Python in 2019: </strong></p>

                <h1>1. Data-Science </h1>

                <p>According to recent studies, Python is the preferred programming language for data scientists. They need an easy-to-use language that has decent library availability and great community participation. Projects that have inactive communities are usually less likely to maintain or update their platforms, which is not the case with Python.</p>
                <p>Python is a multi-paradigm programming language: a sort of Swiss Army knife for the coding world. It supports object-oriented programming, structured programming, and functional programming patterns, among others.</p>
                <p>Python’s inherent readability and simplicity make it relatively easy to pick up and the number of dedicated analytical libraries available today mean that data scientists in almost every sector will find packages already tailored to their needs freely available for download.</p>
                
                <h1>2. Artificial Intelligence</h1>
                <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are the new black of the IT industry. While discussions over safety of its development keep escalating, developers expand abilities and capacity of artificial intellect. Today Artificial Intelligence went far beyond science fiction idea. It became the necessity. Being widely used for processing and analyzing huge volumes of data, AI helps to handle the work that cannot be done manually anymore because of its significantly  increased volumes and intensity.</p>
                <p>According to <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/insights/us/en/focus/tech-trends.html" target="blank">Deloitte</a> research, AI-fueled companies are the latest trend in the technological transformation aimed at improvement of productivity. That is also proved by their prediction that within the next 24 months the number of companies that will use AI in their products and processes to achieve greater efficiency and strategic goals will likely increase. To put it short, AI helps doing better work with fewer efforts.</p>
                
                <h1>3. Web-development</h1>
                <p>Python offers something for everyone through its many frameworks. A framework is a bundle of packages and modules that provide an abstraction, or generic functionality, that can be selectively changed to create application-specific software.</p>
                <p>But how do you know which web framework is right for you? For full-fledged web applications, <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" target="blank">Django</a> and <a href="https://trypyramid.com/" target="blank">Pyramid</a> are the way to go. For better control and visualization or prototyping an app, Web2py or Flask may have something to offer to your project. CheeryPy is a must for simple, minimalist solutions. Tornado will handle 10,000 or more concurrent connections to your app at the same time while Dash is the perfect choice for analytical applications.

                <h1>4. Salary</h1>
                <p>Salary is one of the major reasons why majority is learning python. Big companies like Amazon, Google, Facebook, NetFlix, Instagram and 
                    many other are setting the bar so high that other companies couldn't keep but to hire python developers to get the job done.
